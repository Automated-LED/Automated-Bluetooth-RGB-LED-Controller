![Project Image](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/116276457?s=400&u=3be6016d2022127624cb5783ac66e3a8aaf46fd7&v=4)

The aim of this project is to create a system of automated LED lights that can be controlled through a Bluetooth-enabled device. The system is designed to provide a convenient and efficient way to control lighting in different parts of a home or office.

## Features

- Control LED lights wirelessly via Bluetooth.
- Recognize and respond to commands sent via Bluetooth.
- Change the settings of the lights based on the received commands.
- Save the settings and trigger them upon request.
- Ensure secure and reliable access, allowing only authorized devices to control the lights.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following components:

- Bluetooth-enabled device (e.g., smartphone, tablet, computer)
- Bluetooth module
- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi)
- RGB LED lights
- Power supply

## Setup and Usage

1. Connect the Bluetooth module to the microcontroller.
2. Connect the microcontroller to the RGB LED lights and power supply.
3. Upload the necessary code to the microcontroller.
4. Install and launch the Bluetooth control application on your device.
5. Pair your device with the Bluetooth module.
6. Open the control application and establish a connection.
7. Send commands from the control application to control the LED lights.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement voice control using speech recognition.
- Develop a mobile application with a user-friendly interface.
- Integrate with smart home systems for seamless automation.
- Add additional features like scheduling and color presets.
